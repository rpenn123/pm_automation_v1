/*
MANUAL TRACE (FAILURE PROOF):
1. `processDashboardData` is called with a project that has a status "On Hold" and a deadline of yesterday.
2. `today` is calculated. `deadlineDate` is parsed to yesterday's date.
3. `isComplete` is `false` because "On Hold" is not "Completed" or "Cancelled".
4. `isActive` is `false` because "On Hold" is not "In Progress" or "Scheduled".
5. The code enters the `if (!isComplete)` block.
6. The condition `if (deadlineDate < today)` is checked. `yesterday < today` is TRUE.
7. The code enters the `if` block and increments `monthData[2]` (the overdue count).
8. The function returns. `overdueCount` is 1.
9. The test's assertion `assertEquals(0, 1, ...)` fails.

This confirms the test will fail as expected.
